# Tools

This project is a fullstack project so I should explain by dividing the information into two as client and server.

For frontend part; React Js, CSS <br/>
For backend part; Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary and deploy with Heroku.

# Running Code

If you clone or take this code to your local, firstly you should install npm in the terminal with an npm install statement. After that, separate 2 parts in the terminal for the frontend and backend. When you're inside client folder, you should write `npm start` (it will open local 3000). For the server part, you should  add `npm run dev-window` comment (because I'm a Windows user and if you're using it too, should add it window word)
